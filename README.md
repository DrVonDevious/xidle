== WINDOWS ONLY FOR NOW ==

XIdle is a terminal based idle game written as a means to familiarize myself with many
of the built-in python libraries such as curses, threading and time. Feel free to copy/paste any of the code
that is in the project.

This program uses the curses library, which may not be installed by default.
If you have pip installed, run 'pip install windows-curses' from the command line.

INSTRUCTIONS:

    You will get 1 resource per worker by default.
    You can buy workers by using the buy command (>: buy miner)

COSTS:

    Miner - 15 gold
    Farmer - 40 gold
    Woodcutter - 100 gold and 20 wheat
