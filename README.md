XIdle is a terminal based idle game written by me (William Rutland) as a means to familiarize myself with many
of the built-in python libraries such as curses, threading and time. Feel free to copy/paste any of the code
that is in the project.

This program uses the curses library, which may not be installed by default.
If you have pip installed run 'pip install windows-curses' from the command line.

INSTRUCTIONS:

    You will get 1 resource per worker by default.
    You can buy workers by using the buy command (>: buy miner)

COSTS:

    Miners - 15 gold
    Farmers - 40 gold
    Woodcutters - 100 gold and 20 wheat
